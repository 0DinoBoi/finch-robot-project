# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-oriented design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation


## Description of design choices
We were trying to make the Finch robot to initially dance and play a song at the same time. 
## Challenges faced and solutions
Some challenges I faced were being able to play the song and dance at the same time. Mr Aiello tried to help me and figured to use 2 finch robots. 1 will dance and the other will play the music.
## Future enhancements
I would deffinetly find a way to make it so only 1 finch robot does. I would also love to have added led lights and maybe even words to display on them.
